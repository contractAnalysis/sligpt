Conditions are the expressions that use bitwise operations, logic operations, comparison operations, and variables of bool type. They are the conditions the user refers to. Most importantly, you should be aware that the user targets at the conditions from ##condition_types## statements. You need to ignore the conditions in the return statement.

Here are the given functions:##functions##. Please for each given function find the state variables read in its conditions from ##condition_types## statements and the state variables written by the function. Please note that the state variables are those defined in the contracts outside the scope of functions. Solidity built-in variables like ##solidity_based_variables## are not the state variables I want. Please also note that the conditions in modifiers and called functions are also considered the conditions of the function.
