Therefore, there is no state variable read or used in a condition from assert, require, if, while, for, or ternary operation statements in the modifiers invoked in Function DepositGame.GetBonusWithdraw(). The answer is thus no. d) Function DepositGame.GetBonusWithdraw() has no return statement. Hence there is no state variable used in a condition in the return statement of Function DepositGame.GetBonusWithdraw(). Therefore, the answer is no. e) The related condition of a state variable is the condition through which the state variable is identified based on the given rules. Function DepositGame.GetBonusWithdraw() has one condition: FirstTimeBonus[msg.sender] != true in the if statement. This condition uses the state variable FirstTimeBonus. So, FirstTimeBonus has a related condition. The state variable _balances is used in the function withdraw() which is invoked in Function DepositGame.GetBonusWithdraw(). The condition pendingWithdrawal != 0 in withdraw() is related to _balances. Therefore, both state variables in the given data have related conditions. So, the answer is no. f) Function DepositGame.GetBonusWithdraw() does not have any local variable that is used in a condition from assert, require, if, while, for, or ternary operation statements. Therefore, there is no state variable missed that is used to express the value of a local variable and then this local variable is used in a condition. So, the answer is no.

Therefore, the answer is no. e) The related condition of a state variable is the condition through which the state variable is identified based on the given rules. Function SirotTokenICO.destroy() has one condition assert(balance > 0) in the assert statement, in which 'balance' is a local variable that is expressed by the term using the state variable 'token'. So, assert(balance > 0) is related to 'token'. 'owner' is read in the modifier onlyOwner(), which is invoked in Function SirotTokenICO.destroy(). Therefore, 'owner' is related to the condition in the modifier. Since all the state variables in the given data have related conditions, the answer to this question is no. f) Function SirotTokenICO.destroy() has one local variable 'balance', the value of which can be expressed by a term: token.balanceOf(address(this)) using a state variable 'token'. 'balance' is then used in the condition from the assert statement: assert(balance > 0). Therefore, 'token' is considered as being read in a condition of Function SirotTokenICO.destroy() according to rule 2). Since 'token' is already in the given data, there is no state variable missed due to this local variable 'balance'. Therefore, the answer is no. Since all the answers to the questions are no, the reply should be 'pass'.\",\n  \"Answer\": \"pass\"\n}\n```",
